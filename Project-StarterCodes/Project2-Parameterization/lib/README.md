# Project 2 - Utility Scripts

This directory contains essential utility scripts for Project 2. These scripts support data preprocessing, model implementation, and visualization.

## Contents
- func_file.py - Defines neural network architectures and data preprocessing functions.
- visual_figure3.py - Calculates the linear correlation coefficient to evaluate model performance with different hyperparameters and visualizes the results. Plots illustrate model accuracy and training convergence.
- visual_figure4.py - Analyzes the distribution and errors of network predictions. Includes box plots, probability density histograms, and error histograms to compare model outputs with ground truth data.
